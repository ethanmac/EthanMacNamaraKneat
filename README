I have included the SharpTrooperdll in the files just Incase you want to run the program locally or want to debug it as the DLL location will have been moved.

To view the doumentation just double click on the doc html file In Documentation folder.
To run the program go to the Release folder and run the EthanMacNamaraKneat.exe file.
